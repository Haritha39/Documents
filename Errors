***STACK SMASHING ERROR DETECTED***

This sort of error is usually the result of writing to the location pointed to by an uninitialised pointer or writting off the end of an array (buffer overrun).

It is also one of the hardest types of bug to find.

1. Check all your pointers and arrays.

2. If possible try chopping out chunks of code (starting from the end of the program) until the program starts working without error (although obviously the output may not be correct). There is then a good chance that the bug is in the last bit of code you chopped out. 




***** SEGMENTATION FAULT *****

It occurs if you try to access a location that you dont have permission or that location doesn't exist .
It is generated by hardware .
