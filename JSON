json.dumps(varname)  -> converts any data type in python to json



Of course, this is called "Serialization" - you are dumping a Python data structure into a JSON formatted string:

    json.dumps()

    Serialize obj to a JSON formatted str using this conversion table.

If you load a JSON string with loads(), this would be "deserialization" and you would get a Python list or a dictionary.
