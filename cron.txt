IF we want to run something at specific time by not exclusively telling everytime we need a schedular so that we can fix the time and that schedular runs that job at that time .

IN linux we have cron as a schedular .

it works on cron daemon.

Cron daemon starts working when system boots up and checks every second for tthe crontab files.if present it execute


cron is tthe tool name

crontab is the table that holds our jobs,.

Anacron is one of the job schedular.

AT is also a schedilar but runs only once

Two:

system jobs

user jobs

System jobs :
-------------
fiiles: /etc/crontab

it is used for administrator

intially the inbuilt system backup , update jobs will be there in system.

YOu can define yours by opening :

$ sudo crontab -e

crontab means cron table

-e for edit

-l for listing crontabs

in that you will be having 6 feilds

minutes hours dayofmonth monthofyear weekday command

job start at that hour:minute 

dayofmonth : paricular day

monthofyear : month number

weekday: number to a day

		1 for monday so...on 5 for friday likewise

command : any shell command

 +---------------- minute (0 - 59)
 |  +------------- hour (0 - 23)
 |  |  +---------- day of month (1 - 31)
 |  |  |  +------- month (1 - 12)
 |  |  |  |  +---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7)
 |  |  |  |  |
 *  *  *  *  *  command to be executed



crontab files for sysytem jobs will be stored in /etc/ inside cron.d or cron.daily cron.weekly etc


User jobs :
-----------

unlike system jobs there crontabs will be stored in

/var/spool/cron/crontabs

if you write a individual crontab iwll be stored in tabs under the specified user 

ls crontabs/

haritha root

For user jobs, cron daemon checks in /var/cron.allow and /var/corn.deny to check for to permit whom and not whom
with the sysytem we will get only cron.deny is lpresent

you can write cron.allow , if you write then cron.deny will not work


USES:
-----


1) Backup at nights
2) update at particular time
