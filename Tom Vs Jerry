****** SEGMENTATION FAULT VS STACK SMASHING ERROR *********

 - Segmentation fault is typically when your process is accessing memory location to which it doesn't have permission to access, or that location does not exist.

 - Stack smashing is an alert (generated by gcc for instance) that warns about an access out of bounds, for instance, on the stack. Typically that happens when the stack 

   is written to where it shouldn't - like a local array written to at an index out of bounds.



*********** COMPILER VS INTERPRETER **************

Compiler converts the user code to machine object code. 

Interpreter also converts high level code to some intermediate code and then executes it .
doubt : Interpreter doesn't do it rather than gives directly result .

An interpreter is also a program who is able to translate a high-level language into a low-level one, but it does it at the moment the program is run. He can immediately 

execute high-level programs.

line by line code ni convert cheskuntundhi and run chesesthundhi . so fast .

errors una line varaku code correct ga run avuthadhi .

******************* IMMUTABLE VS MUTABLE ***************

mutable = can be changed

immutable  = cannot be changed 

ex : python : 

		a = 1

		b = a

		id(a) == id(b) == id(1) == same number

	change a to 2 :

		id(a) == differnt id
		id(b) == id(1) == previous id


********************** git pull and git merge ************************

A git pull is going to run a git fetch and then a git merge . If you want to bring your local repository up to speed with a remote repository that is what you would run. A git fetch is going to import commits from a remote repo without merging them, which gives you the opportunity to review them before integrating
