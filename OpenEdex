3.1.1. Open edX Platform on Docker

You can install the Open edX developer stack (Devstack) or the Open edX analytics developer stack (Analytics Devstack).

    Devstack is a set of Docker containers designed for local development. For more information, see Open edX Devstack.
    Analytics Devstack is a modified version of the Devstack installation that allows you to run Open edX Analytics. For more information, see Open edX Analytics Devstack.

You can run Devstack or Analytics Devstack on Linux or macOS. See the Docker downloads page for information about the operating systems and architectures on which you can run Docker.
Open edX Devstack

Devstack is a deployment of the Open edX platform within a set of Docker containers designed for local development. Running the Open edX platform locally allows you to discover and fix system configuration issues early in development.

Devstack simplifies certain production settings to make development more convenient. For example, nginx and gunicorn are disabled in Devstack; Devstack uses Djangoâ€™s runserver instead.

Note

Because of the large number of dependencies needed to develop extensions to Open edX Insights, a separate development environment is available to support Analytics development. For more information, see Installing and Starting Analytics Devstack.

For more information about Docker, see the Docker documentation.



teps to Reproduce:

    Clone open-release/hawthorn.master branch of devstack and _configuration _

    $ git clone --single-branch -b open-release/hawthorn.master https://github.com/edx/devstack.git
    $ git clone --single-branch -b open-release/hawthorn.master https://github.com/edx/configuration.git

    Set environment variable for OPENEDX_RELEASE

    $ export OPENEDX_RELEASE=hawthorn.master

    Go to configuration repo directory and build edxapp image

    $ cd configuration/
    $ docker build --no-cache -t edxops/edxapp:hawthorn.master -f docker/build/edxapp/Dockerfile .

    Go to devstack repo directory, follow the instructions in readme

    $ cd ../devstack
    $ make requirements
    $ make dev.clone
    $ make dev.provision
